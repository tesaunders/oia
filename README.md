Statistics about Official Information Act requests made to New Zealand Government agencies.

The [Official Information Act 1982](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM65364.html) is intended to increase public access to official government information in order to encourage more effective public participation in the making and administration of laws and policies, and to promote the accountability of Ministers and central government agencies. The Act empowers citizens, permanent residents, visitors to New Zealand, and body corporates registered or with a place of business in New Zealand, to make a request for official information held by government agencies, and the agency must make their decision known within 20 working days, unless there is a [good reason](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM65366) to withhold it. The list of agencies subject to the Act are listed [here](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM65921.html).

Official information includes:

- documents, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and drafts
- non-written information, such as video or tape recordings
- the reasons for any decisions that have been made about you
- manuals that set out internal rules, principles, policies or guidelines for decision-making
- agendas and minutes of meetings, including those not open to the public.

If an agency does not have the information you are asking for, and does not believe another agency might have it instead, they do not have to create new information to answer your request. An agency also has the right to request information from you to ensure you are eligible to request information.

If you're unhappy with the response to your request, because it took longer than 20 working days, you didn't get all of the information you requested, or you believe your request was rejected without a valid reason, then you can make a [complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/get-help-public/make-complaint-members-public) and request they investigate.

The [Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1987/0174/latest/DLM122242.html) operates in a similar way for official information held by local government agencies.

You can use [FYI.org.nz](https://fyi.org.nz/) to make an OIA request and receive notifications when there are updates. Your request and any responses are published on the site publicly for others to see, and are added to a large collection of requests made by others that you can browse and search through. 

## Data
Data on OIA statistics for the public sector are published by Te Kawa Mataaho | Public Service Commission on [this page](https://www.publicservice.govt.nz/guidance/official-information/oia-statistics/). 

Under 'Latest Release' download 'OIA Statistics All Data'. 

This data contains duplicate entries for 2016 and 2017 in an apparent attempt to make it easier to compare 2016/2017 data (reported in 12 month periods) with the more recent collection periods (reported in 6 month periods). This effectively doubles the OIA request numbers for these periods so I have removed the 'total' from each of these periods, leaving the total split evenly between the two 6 month periods. 

Data for New Zealand Police shows a wide discrepancy in the number of requests between 2015-2018 and 2019-2023 (inclusive). In a [response](docs/IR-01-23-25549.pdf) to an OIA request, New Zealand Police attribute this discrepancy to improved training around identifying and reporting OIA requests.
