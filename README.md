Statistics about Official Information Act requests made to New Zealand Government agencies.

## Data
Data on OIA statistics for the public sector are published by Te Kawa Mataaho | Public Service Commission on [this page](https://www.publicservice.govt.nz/guidance/official-information/oia-statistics/). 

Under 'Latest Release' download OIA Statistics All Data (OIAStatisticsAllData-v2.xlsx). Open and save as a CSV UTF-8 file in the /data_raw directory. Converting from .xlsx (Excel) to .csv (Comma-separated values) ensures maximum compatibility, and UTF-8 encoding preserves macrons in MƒÅori text.

Check factor levels! I've found some apparent duplication in the OIA data.
Awaiting response from the PSC.
